These next two weeks will be busy times with the expectant mothers gathered to a shed for lambing.  We need to keep a close eye on them so we can isolate them with their lambs in “jugs”. Moms will be treated to plush accommodations of high protein hay and supplements. They will also be given as much peace and quiet as we can provide so they can nurse their lambs. These first few days are essential for bonding and establishing immunity in their lambs.
