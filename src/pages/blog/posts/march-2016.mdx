An early spring seems to be on the way. Yesterday we heard the geese begin to return and the grass started to green up. But that nagging voice in the back of my head reminds me that 36″ March snows are not that unusual. Still we have been grateful for these balmy days to give us a chance to set up the gates for weighing the “gals” and getting them ready for lambing. We decided to lamb late this year– April/May. Quite a few are looking rotund already.
